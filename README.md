# Leng
Leng meaning "Cold" in Chinese, is a engine framework similar to "[Love Universe](https://github.com/alphafantomu/Love-Universe)" meant to be utilized for the LÖVE framework. Leng handles custom objects, enumerations, data types, drawing, and frame updates, but also supplies API for things like audio configuration, time and space manipulation etc. The difference between "Leng" and "Love Universe" is that "Love Universe" tries to replicate Roblox's framework, while "Leng" is more of my original work and API, how [I](https://github.com/alphafantomu) would optimize, utilize and handle data.

### Why did you make this?
I, [Ari](https://github.com/alphafantomu), simply made this for learning and enjoyment purposes. I thought that making an engine framework would be very fun and interesting, and it is. I am hoping to greatly improve my code through this project in different aspects.

### Who maintains this project?
For a little bit of time quite literally a minute or two, my organization "地平線を越えた伝説" and team "Unending" maintained this project, however I transfered the project to myself, Ari, because I felt this project was more about and directed towards me, not my organization or team.

### How do I use Leng?
Most of your answers about Leng, installation, usage, API, objects, what droplets are can be found at the wiki which you can find [here](/wiki).

### Status
Leng is currently not able to be fully utilized, as the framework is not in a stage where it is usable. **Once the project is usable, a packaged release will be available at this project github page**. Love Universe will most likely not be continued any further, as Leng can be seen as something more refined.
